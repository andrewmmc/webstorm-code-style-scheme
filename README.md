> For WebStorm or PhpStorm by JetBrains

> JavaScript Standard Style fans? No need this repo: Just go to `Preferences` > `Editor` > `Code Style` > `JavaScript`, and click `Set from` > `Predefined Style` > `JavaScript Standard Style`.

## Get Started
1. Clone this repo.
2. To install it, go `Preferences` > `Editor` > `Code Style`, click the gear icon next to `Scheme` and click `Import Scheme` > `IntelliJ IDEA code style XML`.
3. It is suggested to use ESLint to check code style as well, especially if you are using Airbnb Javascript Style. [Follow this guide](https://www.themarketingtechnologist.co/eslint-with-airbnb-javascript-style-guide-in-webstorm/) to setup ESLint in your project and make it works in your IDE.
